# Udacity Feed Reader Testing
---

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. It included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/), and I was tasked with the job of writing test suites to ensure full and complete page functionality.

## How to Run
---
* Download the repository:
* Click download ZIP on the right of the screen, then extract the zip file to your computer, or clone the repository using git.
* Navigate to where you unzipped the file or cloned the repository.
* Double-click index.html to open the Feed Reader in your browser

## Jasmine
---
Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code. The passed tests can be viewed at the bottom of the webpage, with the original test code coming from the feedreader.js file.
